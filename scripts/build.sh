# build.sh — Build, sign, and bundle vphone-cli (+ cross-compile vphoned).
#
# This is the bootstrap step that a running binary cannot do for itself:
# it compiles the vphone-cli binary, signs it with the PV=3 entitlements,
# wraps it in the .app bundle used for GUI boot, and cross-compiles + signs
# the vphoned guest daemon. Everything else in the project is driven by the
# resulting `vphone-cli` binary — this script is the only build entrypoint.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/build.sh              # build + sign + bundle + vphoned
#   ./scripts/build.sh --no-vphoned # skip the vphoned cross-compile
